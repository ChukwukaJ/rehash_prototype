# Rehash – Prototype

Rehash Connect is a prototype platform that creates a safe space for collaborations between African and global creatives, using intimate live and virtual music experiences instead of only big loud concerts.

Prototype built as part of the **Introduction to Software Engineering** summative at ALU.  
It reflects the main functional and non-functional requirements from the SRS:

- Simulated login / role switching (Artist or Audience)
- Artist dashboard with profile, snippets and event creation
- Audience dashboard with recommended artists and upcoming events
- Explore page to search and filter artists by name, country or genre
- Demo collaboration room with simple chat
- Demo live event view with audience chat

## 1. System Description

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this prototype is to demonstrate how Rehash Connect can support fair, intimate collaboration opportunities between African and global artists, beyond a small group of A-list stars. It focuses on experiences that allow artists and audiences to connect more deeply.

### 1.2 Scope

The prototype covers only the **frontend** of the system:

- Role-based views (Artist / Audience)
- Basic data interactions in the browser (no real backend)
- Simple event management and messaging simulations

It does *not* include real authentication, payments, streaming, or persistent storage.

### Option A – Open directly

1. Download the repo as a ZIP from GitHub and extract it.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double–click it).

### Option B – Using Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChukwukaJ/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
